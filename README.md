## NLP project at Politecnico di Milano about AUTEXTIFICATION: Automatic Text Identification

**Literata Team:** Zheng Maria Yu, Alessio Hu, Jakub JastrzÄ™bski, Joanna Rancew

The project **AUTEXTIFICATION: Automatic Text Identification** covers both **binary classification** to *distinguish between generated text and human-written text*, and **multi-class classification** to predict *what language model generated particular text*.

The notebook is structured into two main subtasks:
- **Subtask 1: Human or Generated**,
- **Subtask 2: Which Generation model**.

Each subtask begins with data preprocessing and visualizations. Subsequently, a comprehensive collection of models trained on the dataset is presented, ranging from simple machine learning classifiers to various neural networks and transformers.

To facilitate navigation within the notebook, use a table of contents on the left (Colab) to easy access to different sections.

If you want to run the code on your own, remember to use GPU for transformers!
