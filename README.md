## NLP project at Politecnico di Milano about AUTEXTIFICATION: Automatic Text Identification

**Literata Team:** Zheng Maria Yu, Alessio Hu, Jakub JastrzÄ™bski, Joanna Rancew

Project: **AUTEXTIFICATION: Automatic Text Identification** covers both **binary classification** to *distinguish between generated text and human-written text*, and **multi-class classification** to predict *what language model generated particular text*.

The notebook is structured into two main subtasks: **Subtask 1: Human or Generated** and **Subtask 2: Which Generation model**. Each subtask begins with data preprocessing and visualizations. Subsequently, a comprehensive collection of models trained on the dataset is presented, ranging from simple machine learning classifiers to various neural networks and transformers.
To facilitate navigation within the notebook use a table of contents on the left (colab) to easy access to different sections.
